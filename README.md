# p2ps

**p2ps** is a Rust library designed to make it easy to establish a secure connection between two peers using the [Diffie-Hellman algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange).

## Usage example (Sync)

#### Peer A
```rust
use std::net::TcpListener;
use p2ps::P2psConn;

let listener = TcpListener::bind("peer_b_address:port")?;
let (mut stream, _) = listener.accept()?;
let mut p2ps_conn = P2psConn::listen_handshake(stream)?;
```

#### Peer B
```rust
use std::net::TcpStream;
use p2p_secure::P2psConn;

let stream = TcpStream::connect("peer_b_address:port")?;
let mut p2ps_conn = P2psConn::send_handshake(&mut stream)?;

```

now both peers can use their p2ps_conn to share data

#### Peer A
``` rust
let data = b"Hello, peer B!";
p2ps_conn.write(data)?;
```

#### Peer B
```rust
let decrypted_data = p2ps_conn.read()?;
println!("Received data: {}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&decrypted_data));
```

## Objective
The goal of this project is to provide a simple and efficient way to create encrypted peer-to-peer connections without relying on external authorities.
